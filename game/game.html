    <h3>Summary Content</h3>
    <p>I have changed the text based interface to a colored square one. All squares are clickable. When a square is clicked the script determines if it was a ruin then color codes it accordingly. Stats about 
        the clicks are noted to the right of the game. When a ruin is completely dug out a  message is displayed. A message is also displayed when the player discovers all ruins 
        the player is then given a rating based on their total clicks to find all the ruins. </p>
